From Clause:
	-from caluse will start the exectuion we can pass table name as an argument in the from caluse.
	-The job from clause is to go to database, serch fro the table and put the table under exectuion.
	- Syntax:  from <table_name>;
	
Select Clause:
	- select caluse will execute after the from clause.
	- we can pass column name, or expresion or asterisk(*) as an argument in the select clause.
	- the job of select clause is to go to table which is under exectuion, select the data and display it.
	- select clause is responsible for resultant table or final output.
	- Syntax: select */[distinct]/col_name/expresion/[alias].
	
	Semicolon(;):
		- determines ends of the statement of terminute the statement.
	
	Comma(,):
		- we can pass multiple column and expresion in the select clause by seprateing them using a seprater comma.

	Asterisk(*):
		- it is used to select all or everything.
		- (*) is used to select all or everything but (*) must and should used as only argument in the select clause.
		- if you want display all the details along with some extra column an expresion we haveto follow the syntax.
		- syntax: select <table_name>.*, <col_name>/ exp[alias] from <table_name>;
		
	Expression:
		- a statement with provides a result we called as an expresion.
		- an expresion consists of two things operand, operator(+,-,*,/);
		
		operand are of two types:
			1. column_name.
			2. literals("direct value").
			
		literals are of three types
			1. Number literals.
			2. character literals.
			3. Data literals.
			
		- From this we can state that an expresion is nothing but combincation of operand as well as operator.
		
		Note:
			the character literals and date literals must and should inclosed within single qoute
			name: 'shyam';
			date: '21-feb-2002';
			
Alias:
	- it is an alternative name given to column name and expresion that for resultant table.
	- alias can provide by as single word alias,
	- alias can provides by using or without using as keyword.
	- alias can be provide as multiple word seprated by underscore(_).
	- alias can be given as string but should be enclosed withing duble qoutes (" ").
	- alias in not mandatory but always recommended to provide.
	
Distinct clause:
	- it is used to remove the duplicated and reapated value from the resultant table.
	- distinct clause should be used as first argument in select clause.
	- we can pass col_name or expresion as an argument in the distinct clause.
	- we can pass multiple column or expresion in the distinct clause whenever we are passing multiple 
	  column_name and expresion in the distinct it always remove the combincation of duplicate from all the column.
