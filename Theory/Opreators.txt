Operators:
	-operators is symbol, which is used to perfrom specific task.
	- types of operators
		1. Arithamatic Operator.(+,-,*,/)
		2. Comparision operator.(==, !=)
		3. Relational Operator.(<,>,>=, <=)
		4. Logical Operator.(AND, OR , NOT)
		5. Concatenaction Operator.(||)
		6. Special Operator.(IN, NOT IN, LIKE, NOT LIKE, BETWEEN, NOT BETWEEN, IS, IS NOT)
		7. Sub Query Operator(ALL, ANY, EXIST, NOT EXIST)
		
	
	4. Logical operator:
			1. AND
			2. OR
			3. NOT
			
		AND : - AND operator which is used to perfrom binary multiplication
			  - AND operator return true if all the condtions get staticfy.
		
		OR : - OR operator which is used to perfrom binary addition.
			 - OR operator return true if at least one condtions get staticfy.
			 - we used OR operator in between to condtions.
		
		NOt:  
		
	5. Concatenaction Operator :
			- it is used to join the given two string
			- operator(||).
			
	6. Special Operator :
		
		1. IN operator:
			- it is a multivalued operator which take mutiple value RHS.
			- IN operator return true if atleast one value or condtion get staticefied.
			syntax:
					where col_name IN (val_1, val_2, ... val_n);
			
		2. NOT IN:
			-it is just similar to IN Operator which take multiple value in  RHS but instend of selecting value
			 it will reject the value.
			 syntax:
					where col_name NOT IN (val_1, val_2, ... val_n);
			 
		3.BETWEEN:
			- comparing the particualr range value.
			- whenever we have range we used between operator.
			- between operator works including the rnge value.
			- we can't interchange ragne value.
			
				
		4. NOT BETWEEN:
			- it is just similar to between operator but instend of selecting the range it will reject the range.
			syntax:
				where col_name  NOT BETWEEN  <starting value > And <ending value>;
				
		5. LIKE:
			- it is used to mathc the pattern.
			syntax: 
				Where col_name like 'pattern_to_match';
				
			- we achive the pattern matching by using two special character.
					percentile (%)
					underscore (_)
					
				percentile (%):
					it can accept any character, any no of time even no character.
					
				underscore (_):
					it can accept any character but only once.
					
		6. NOT LIKE:
			- it is just similar to like Operator but instend of considering the pattern it will reject the pattern.
			syntax: 
				Where col_name like 'pattern_to_match';
				
		7. IS Operator:
			-It is special operator which is used to compare with null.
			syntax  
				where col_name IS null;
		
		8. IS NOT :
			- it is just similar to IS operator but instend of considering the null it will reject Null.
			syntax  
				where col_name IS NOT null;
