Datatypes:
	Datatype is a type of data or kind of data used to store in memmory.
	
	Types of datatype:
		char();
		varchar();
		varchar2();
		character large object clob;
		binary large object blob;
		date
		number
		timestamp;
		
char:
	-the char datatype is fixed length memmory allocation
	-in char datatype unused memmory box is wested.
	-the maximum length is 2000 memmory block.
	-whenever you want to store fixed length value than used char datatype.
	-ex. mono,addhar_card_no, pan_no, studid.
	
varchar:
	-the varchar datatype is variable length memmory allocation.
	-in varchar datatype unused memmory box is recyled.
	-it is slower as compare char datatype.
	-the maximum length is 2000 memmory block.
	
varhcar2();
	-VARCHAR2 is the same as VARCHAR in the oracle database. 
	-The main difference is that VARCHAR is ANSI Standard and VARCHAR2 is Oracle standard.
	-The VarChar2 data type is used to store the character values. 
	-It is a variable-length data type i.e. we can change the size of the character variable at execution time. 
	 Hence, it is also called a Dynamic datatype.
	-It is used to store normal characters and alphanumeric characters too. 
	-The VARCHAR2 data type can store a character string of a maximum length of 4000 bytes of characters.
	
CLOB:
	-CLOB, or Character Large Object, is a data type that stores large amounts 
	of character data in a database management system:
	-The size of clob is 4 GB.
	-syntax : CLOB;
	
BLOB:
	A BLOB (Binary Large Object) data type stores binary data in a database. 
	BLOBs can store a variety of data types, including:
	Images, Videos, Audio files, Documents, Archives, Executable files, and Backups. 
	BLOBs are used to store files that are too large to fit in regular fields.
	The size of blob is 4 GB.
	For example, you can use a BLOB column to store a user's profile picture
	
Date:
	It is a datatype used to store day,month,and year.
	syntax: date;
	format: "dd-mon-yyyy";
			"dd-mon-yy";
			
Number(p,s):
	-It is a datatped used to store integer value and float values
	-number(p). it will store integer value only.
	-number(p,s) it will store float value only.
	
timestamp:
	it will store date & time information including miliscond.
	format :"dd-mon-yy hh:mm:ss:ms";
	
Constraints:
	it is a set of condition used to validate the data entered into the cell.
		-unique
		-not null
		-check
		-primary key
		-foreign key
		-default
		
unique:
	-it is a constraint used to avoid dupilicate data entered into the cell.
	
Not null:
	-it is a constraint used to represent something in a cell.
	-null : null is keyword which represent nothing in a cell.
	
check:
	it is a constraint used to add extra condition.
	for example:
		check (length(ename)=10);
		check (age>=18 and age <=60);
		check (length(pinNo)=6)
		
Primary key:
	- It is a key used to uniquely identified row in table.
	- it should be unique.
	- it should be not null.
	- it is combination of unique and not null.
	- in table should be only one primary key.
	- primary key represent table.
	- primary key is not mandatory.
	
foreign key:
	- it is a key used to make connection one table to another table.
	- it can be unique.
	- it can be not null.
	- it is not combination of unique and not null.
	- primary key of one table, should be foreign key of another table.
	- foreign key we can have multiple in a table.
	- it is also knows as refrence integrarity constraint.
	- it is presents in child table.
