	ther are two types:
		1. inbuilt /pre-defined function.
		2. user definbed function.

	ther are two types of inbuilt function.
		1. Single row Function.
		2. Multi row Function / aggregate / Group .

1. Single Row Function.
	- single row function execute row-by-row.
	- it takes one input execute it an generate an output than it will go next input.
	- if we pass n no.of input to single row function it will return n no.of output.
	
2. Multi Row Function.
	- multirow function can also called as aggregate Function or group function.
	- it takes all input at once and aggregate it combines and generate one single output.
	- if we pass n no.of input to multirow function it will return only one single output.
	
	types of multirow function:
	
		1. max()
		2. min()
		3. sum()
		4. avg()
		5. count()
		
1. max():
	it is used to find the maximum value from the pass the arguments.
2. min():
	it is used to find the minimum value from the pass the arguments.
3. sum():
	it is used  find the toatal of summation of the value from the pass the arguments.
4. avg():
	it is used to find the Average value from the pass the arguments.
5. count():
	it is used to find the no.of  value from the pass the arguments.
