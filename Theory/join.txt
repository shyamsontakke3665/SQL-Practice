Joins:-
	retrive data from multiple table simultaneously.
	types of join:
		1.Cross Joins.
		2.Inner join.
		3.Natrual join.
		4.Outer join.
			1.left outer join.
			2.right outer join.
			3.full outer join.
		5.Self join.
		
1. Cross Joins:-
		it is join used to get combination of one table with another table.
		 -matched record.
		 -unmatched record.
		 -error record.
		
		syntax anssi:
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1> cross join <table2>;
			
		oracle :
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1>,<table2>;
			
What is the error record?
		-the null value compare if any vlaue the result should be null but cross join get some output that is knows as eorror record.
		-even their no connection between two table cross join diliver some output that is knows as error record.
		
2. Inner join:
		- it is join used to get only the matched record.
		- inner join is alos knows as equi-join.
		
		syntax anssi:
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1> inner join <table2>
			on<table1.key_attribute>=<table2.key_attribute>
			
		oracle :
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1>,<table2>
			where <table1.key_attribute>=<table2.key_attribute> and <condition>.
			
3. Natrual join:
		whenever we don't know the table structure we can use natrual join.
		- it is types of inner join.

		case1. when natrually these is connection between two table natural join gives output of inner join(matched records).
		case2. when natrually these is no connection between two table the natrual join gives o/p of error record.
		
		syntax anssi:
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1> natrual join <table2>;
			
		- it has no oracle syntax because it is same as cross join.
		
4. outer join:
		- it is join used to get both match and unmatch records.
		
	1. left outer join:-
		- it is join used to get both match and unmatch rocords in left side table.
		syntax anssi:
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1> left outer join <table2>
			on<table1.key_attribute>=<table2.key_attribute>
			
		oracle :
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1>,<table2>
			where <table1.key_attribute>=<table2.key_attribute>(+); 
			
	2. Right outer join:-
		- it is join used to get both match and unmatch rocords in right side table.
		syntax anssi:
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1> right outer join <table2>
			on<table1.key_attribute>=<table2.key_attribute>
			
		oracle :
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1>,<table2>
			where <table1.key_attribute>=<table2.key_attribute>(+); 
			
	3. Full outer join:-
		- it is join used to get both table match  and unmatch records.
		
		syntax anssi:
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1> full outer join <table2>
			on<table1.key_attribute>=<table2.key_attribute>	 
		
		-there no oracle syntax for full outer join because is same as inner join.
		
Self join:-
		- it is join, retrival data with in same table but output is present in differnt rows.
		
		syntax. 
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1> <alias name>  join <table2> <alias name>
			on <alias name>.col_name= <alias name>.<col_name>;
			
		orace:
			select col_1, col_2, ... col_n
			from <table1> <alias name>, <table2> <alias name>
			where <alias name>.col_name=<alias name>.<col_name>;
